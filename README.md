## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
### What I learned
though,i have knowledge on how to use FlexBox but this challenge gave me more understanding on how to use FlexBox.
To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
